## Theories and Principles

### Correlation method

The correlation(unnormalized) is defined as
$$
R(i,j) = \sum_{l = 1}^M\sum_{m = 1}^MW(l,m)S^{i,j}_M(l,m),i,j \in[1,L-M+1]
$$
It is clear that unnomalized correlation can not be used to registrate, so nomalization is necessary
$$
R^2_N(i,j) = \frac{(\sum_{l = 1}^M\sum_{m = 1}^MW(l,m)S^{i,j}_M(l,m))^2}{(\sum_{l = 1}^M\sum_{m 
= 1}^MW(l,m))^2(\sum_{l = 1}^M\sum_{m = 1}^MS^{i,j}_M(l,m))^2},i,j \in[1,L-M+1]
$$
Basically, the correlation method has a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$. Using FFT will improve a lot, but still cost much time, that is where **SSDA(sequential similarity detection algorithms)** comes in.

### SSDA

Every time a reference point is given, there will be $M^2$ multiplications. We call $<W(l,m),S^{i,j}_M(l,m)>$ a *window pair*. The complexity of the primitive algorithm originates from the fact that not every window pair is important and worth $M^2$ times calculation.

SSDA reduces this redundancy by performing a sequential search which may be terminated before all $M^2$ windowing pairs for a particular reference point are tested.

The basic idea of the SSDA is 

1. Define the distance of the pictures
2. Choose a sequence for inceasing-scale image and calculate their distance
3. Set a threshold, and take down the index in sequence that the distance exceeds the threshold.
4. Construct the SSDA surface and check the correlation according to this

### Fourier-Mellin Method

Suppose we have a reference image $r$(the original one) and a pattern image $ p$ related by RST transformation:
$$
r(x,y) = p(\Delta x+s*(x\cos \phi-y\sin\phi),\Delta y+s*(x\sin\phi+y\cos\phi))
$$
  Their frquency is related by 
$$
F_s(\omega_x,\omega_y) = s^2F_p((\omega_x\cos\phi+\omega_y\sin\phi)/s,(-\omega_x\sin\phi+\omega_y\cos\phi)/s )\exp(j2\pi(\omega_x\Delta x+\omega_y\Delta y)/s)
$$
The magnitude of $F_p$ is derived from the magnitude of $F_r$ by rotating Fr by $-\phi$ and shrinking its extent by a factor of $s$.

The translation has its effect the phase rather than on the magnitude, so the magnitude is invariant under the tranlational transform. This is called **Fourier-Mellin Invariance**. The magnitude domain is referred to as the **Fourier-Mellin domain**, denote
$$
R = |F_r| \\
P = |F_p|
$$
By operating in Fourier-Mellin domain, translation is decoupled with rotation and scale, so the next step is to decouple the rotation and scale. This is done by transforming to log-polar space.

### Log-polar analysis

We transform the Cartesian to polar
$$
\rho = \sqrt{\omega_x^2+\omega_y^2} \\
\theta = \arctan\frac{\omega_y}{\omega_x}
$$
and define a rotation invariant 
$$
S_r(\log \rho) = \frac{1}{\rho}\int_0^\pi R(\rho\cos\theta,\rho\sin\theta)d\theta
$$
Then by correlation of $S_r$, translation parameter can be found. 

We can also tranform R and P both, suppose
$$
M_1(\log\rho,\theta) = R(\omega_x,\omega_y) \\
M_2(\log\rho,\theta) = P(\omega_x,\omega_y) \\
$$
Then we have
$$
M_1(\log\rho,\theta) = M_2(\log\rho-\log s,\theta-\phi)
$$
